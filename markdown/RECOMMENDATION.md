# Recommendation for AAA Algorithm Issues

## Current Status

After extensive debugging and multiple fix attempts, we've identified the core issues:

1. **Root Cause**: JAX's automatic differentiation produces NaN when differentiating through discontinuous functions (the original `barycentric_eval` with `jnp.where`)

2. **Partial Success**: 
   - AAA_LS now works correctly with smooth_barycentric_eval
   - AAA_TwoStage also works
   - AAA_FullOpt still fails despite fixes

3. **AAA_SmoothBary**: Produces catastrophically wrong results (errors up to 1e+71)

## Why AAA_FullOpt Keeps Failing

The fundamental issue is that optimizing support points (zj) simultaneously with weights/values creates an unstable optimization landscape where:
- Support points can drift close to data points
- This causes near-singularities in the rational function
- Gradients become NaN/Inf
- Optimization fails silently

## Recommended Solution

Based on insights from the Remez algorithm and Vector Fitting, I recommend:

### Option 1: Use AAA_LS as Primary Method (Immediate)
- It works reliably now
- Fixed support points avoid the instability
- Performance is good enough for most applications

### Option 2: Replace AAA_FullOpt with Stable Version (If needed)
I've created `stable_aaa_fullopt.py` that uses alternating optimization:
1. Fix zj, optimize fj/wj (stable linear-like problem)  
2. Fix fj/wj, carefully update zj with constraints
3. This matches how Vector Fitting and other stable rational approximation methods work

The stable version produces all finite derivatives up to order 7.

### Option 3: Reduce Derivative Order Requirements
- Testing derivatives up to order 7 is pushing numerical limits
- Even working methods show exponential growth in higher derivatives
- Consider limiting to order 4 or 5 for practical applications

## Implementation Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use AAA_LS for benchmarks (it's working)
2. **Optional**: Replace AAA_FullOpt implementation with the stable alternating version
3. **Remove**: AAA_SmoothBary - it's fundamentally flawed
4. **Config**: Set derivative_orders to 5 instead of 7 in benchmark_config.json

## Code Changes Needed

```python
# In comprehensive_methods_library.py, replace AAA_FullOpt._fit_implementation 
# with the alternating optimization approach from stable_aaa_fullopt.py

# Or simply disable AAA_FullOpt in benchmark_config.json:
"python_methods": {
    "base_methods": [
        "AAA_LS",           # Works well
        # "AAA_FullOpt",    # Unstable - disable
        # "AAA_SmoothBary", # Broken - remove
        "AAA_TwoStage",     # Works
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Summary

The core mathematical issue is clear: simultaneous optimization of rational function support points is numerically unstable. The standard solution in approximation theory is to use alternating/staged optimization, which is what successful methods like Vector Fitting do.

Rather than continuing to patch a fundamentally unstable approach, I recommend using the working methods (AAA_LS, AAA_TwoStage) and considering the derivative order requirements.
